# Drayton Wiser Binding

This binding integrates the [Drayton Wiser Smart Heating System](https://wiser.draytoncontrols.co.uk/). The integration happens through the HeatHub, which acts as an IP gateway to the ZigBee devices (thermostats and TRVs).

## Supported Things

The Drayton Wiser binding supports the following things:
* Bridge - The network device in the controller that allows us to interact with the other devices in the system
* Controller - The _HeatHub_ attached to the boiler. This also acts as the hub device.
* Rooms - Virtual groups of _Room Thermostats_ and _TRVs_ that can have temperatures and schedules
* Room Thermostats - Wireless thermostats which monitor temperature and humidity, and call for heat
* Smart TRVs - Wireless TRVs that monitor temperature, alter the radiator valve state and call for heat
* Hot Water - Virtual thing to manage hot water states

## Discovery

The HeatHub can be discovered automatically via mDNS, however the `SECRET` cannot be determined automatically. Once the `SECRET` has been configured, all other devices can be discovered by triggering device discovery again.

## Binding Configuration

None required

## Thing Configuration

### HeatHub Configuration

Once discovered, the HeatHub `AUTHTOKEN` needs to be configured. There are a few ways to obtain this, assuming you have already configured the system using the Wiser App.

1. Temporarily install a packet sniffing tool on your mobile device. Every request made includes the `SECRET` in the header.
2. Enable setup mode on the HeatHub. Connect a machine temporarily to the `WiserHeat_XXXXX` network and browse to `http://192.168.8.1/secret` to obtain the `AUTHTOKEN`.

The `REFRESH` interval defines in seconds, how often the binding will poll the controller for updates.

The `AWAY MODE SET POINT` defines the temperature in degrees Celsius that will be sent to the heathub when away mode is activated.

### Manual configuration with .things files

```
Bridge draytonwiser:heathub:HeatHub [ ADDR="192.168.1.X", REFRESH=60, AUTHTOKEN="authtoken from hub" ]
{
	controller controller
	room livingroom	[ roomName="Living Room" ]
	room bathroom	[ roomName="Bathroom" ]
	room bedroom	[ roomName="Bedroom" ]
	roomstat livingroomstat [ serialNumber="ABCDEF1234" ]
	itrv livingroomtrv [ serialNumber="ABCDEF1235" ]
	hotwater hotwater
}
```

The `roomName` corresponds to the room name configured in the Wiser App. It is not case sensitive. The `serialNumber` corresponds to the device serial number which can be found on a sticker inside the battery compartment of the Smart Valves/TRVs, and behind the wall mount of the Room Thermostats.
